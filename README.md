# camera_android

The Android implementation of [`camera`][1].

## Usage

This package is [endorsed][2], which means you can simply use `camera`
normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do,
so you do not need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

However, if you `import` this package to use any of its APIs directly, you
should add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as usual.

### Issue

    https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/114012

### Occasionally reproduce this crash:

Continuously enter and exit the camera page, crash occurs between the 100th and 300th time.

### 100% Re-Produce the issue steps:

1. Set two breakpoints in `io.flutter.plugins.camera.Camera` [Camera.java](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/camera_android-v0.10.8%252B5/packages/camera/camera_android/android/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/camera/Camera.java) :
   - breakpoint 1: [Line 1228](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/867f2a4c929a0afe881ca4277f27d260952f4fb2/packages/camera/camera_android/android/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/camera/Camera.java#L1228) `captureSession.close();`
   - breakpoint 2: [Line 1263](https://github.com/flutter/packages/blob/867f2a4c929a0afe881ca4277f27d260952f4fb2/packages/camera/camera_android/android/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/camera/Camera.java#L1263) `captureSession = null;`
2. Push the camera view in then pop it out after the camera is working.
3. Continue the thread from breakpoint 2 -> breakpoint 1, crash raised.

### How-to fix:

Just add `synchronized` key to this three close method

    synchronized void closeCaptureSession() {
    // on Line 1224
    ...

    synchronized public void close() {
    // on Line 1233
    ...

    synchronized private void stopAndReleaseCamera() {
    // on Line 1256
    ...
